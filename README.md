Utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs, I developed a comprehensive Weather Forecast Application. This project showcases my proficiency in front-end web development and integration with external data sources.

The Weather Forecast Application provides users with up-to-date weather information for their specified location. Leveraging APIs such as OpenWeatherMap, the application retrieves real-time weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

The user interface is designed with HTML and styled with CSS to ensure an intuitive and visually appealing experience. JavaScript is employed to handle user interactions and dynamically update the weather information displayed on the page without requiring a page refresh.

This project demonstrates my ability to work with external APIs, manipulate data in real-time, and create responsive web designs for optimal user experience across devices. It serves as a testament to my skills in front-end development and my capability to deliver practical solutions that provide value to end-users.
